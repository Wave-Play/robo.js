## What is Robo.js?

Robo.js powers Discord with activities, bots, web servers, and more. It emphasizes effortless integration, dynamic plugins, and advanced debugging built on top of Discord.js.

## Plugin Architecture

- Plugins extend Robo with commands, events, middleware, API routes, and other features while remaining optional.
- `npx robo add <name>` installs the plugin's npm package, seeds any starter files, and registers it in your config.
- Plugins can also be registered manually by placing `.mjs` or `.ts` files inside `config/plugins`.
- During `robo build`, plugin files are indexed for fast startup and plugins may inject build steps or generate code.
- At runtime, Robo loads plugin options from the config, executes lifecycle hooks, and routes commands, events, and middleware to plugin handlers.
- Plugin packages live in this repo under `packages/` and usually ship a README with usage instructions.

## Core Framework Files

- `packages/robo/src/core/config.ts` – Loads project configuration and scans `/config/plugins` for plugin configs.
- `packages/robo/src/core/robo.ts` – Runtime entry: starts/stops Robo, loads plugin options, and triggers lifecycle events.
- `packages/robo/src/core/handlers.ts` – Executes command, event, and middleware handlers while respecting plugin and module settings.
- `packages/robo/src/core/portal.ts` – Indexes commands/events and exposes helpers like `getPluginOptions` for plugin data.
- `packages/robo/src/core/logger.ts` – Provides structured logging with support for plugin-specific loggers.
- `packages/robo/src/core/flashcore.ts` – Manages persistent data via the Flashcore storage layer.
- `packages/robo/src/core/env.ts` – Loads environment variables for Robo and its plugins.
- `packages/robo/src/core/state.ts` – Handles state persistence across restarts.
