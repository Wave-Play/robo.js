# 🔰 Beginner Guide

Despite how simple **Robo.js** make things, it can be a bit overwhelming at first. There's a lot to take in, but don't worry! This guide will help you get started with the basics of creating a **Discord Bot**.

Before we get started, make sure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** installed alongside **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or your favorite code editor.

## Running

Once you've **[created a Robo](/cli/create-robo)**, you can run it in your **Terminal**.

<Terminal>npm run dev</Terminal>

:::tip

Make sure your **[Credentials](/discord-bots/credentials)** are set up correctly first.

## Slash Commands

Creating a **Slash Command** is as easy as creating files.

Let's say you want a new `/hello` command. Just create a file in the `/src/commands` directory named `hello.js` and export a default function that returns something.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript title="/src/commands/hello.js"
export default () => {
	return 'Hello World!'
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript title="/src/commands/hello.ts"
import type { CommandResult } from 'robo.js'

export default (): CommandResult => {
	return 'Hello World!'
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your `/hello` command is now ready to use! **Robo.js** takes care of registration for you.

Miss your interaction object? Don't worry, it's still there!

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript title="/src/commands/hello.js"
export default (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply('Hello World!')
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript title="/src/commands/hello.ts"
import type { ChatInputCommandInteraction } from 'discord.js'
import type { CommandResult } from 'robo.js'

export default (interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction): CommandResult => {
	interaction.reply('Hello World!')
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is just the beginning. Nest folders to create subcommands, make your export async to defer, define options, and more.

</CardContainer>

## Context Commands

Ever right clicked on someone's profile or a message and seen an "Apps" section? Those are context commands!

Creating and registering context commands in Robo.js is no different from regular commands. The `/context` directory can have two subdirectories: `/user` and `/message`. Just like commands, the name of the file becomes the name of the context command.

## Event Listeners

Listening to events using Robo.js again follows the same file structure. Create a file in the `events` directory, and the name of the file becomes the Discord event you're listening to. Noticing a pattern here?

### Example Usage

Registering an event listener is as simple as creating a file in the `/src/events` directory.

<Tabs groupId="examples-script">
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript showLineNumbers title="/src/events/messageCreate.js"
export default (message) => {
	if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
		message.channel.send('Hello there!')
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript showLineNumbers title="/src/events/messageCreate.ts"
import type { Message } from 'discord.js'

export default (message: Message) => {
	if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
		message.channel.send('Hello there!')
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your default export is the equivalent of `client.on('messageCreate', (message) => {})` in Discord.js. The same exact parameters are passed to your event listener function.

## Sage Mode

Sage Mode is a powerful feature in Robo.js that simplifies interaction handling. It operates behind the scenes, automatically simplifying interaction handling and providing smart error replies to make debugging easier.
