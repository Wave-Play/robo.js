# ✨ Getting Started with Discord Bots

**Robo.js** makes building bots with **[Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)** as easy as placing files in the right place.

Create a **[Slash Command](./commands)** by making a file in `/src/commands`; the file name becomes the command. **[Context Commands](./context-menu)** and **[Events](./events)**? Just as easy! This is more than just a command handler - it's a full-fledged **[Framework](/robojs/overview)** and **[Ecosystem](/plugins/directory)**.

**Got an existing bot?** Check out the **[Migration Guide](./migrate)** for how to use existing code with **Robo.js**.

:::tip Robo.js does _not_ replace Discord.js!

Instead, it simplifies development by managing your project. You still have all of **Discord.js**!

:::

## Quick Start

Ready to start your adventure? Try **[Create Robo](../cli/create-robo)** in your terminal:

<Terminal create>{'<projectName>'}</Terminal>

This will help spawn a new **Robo.js** project as a **Discord Bot**. We call these **Robos**.

## Documentation

If you already know **Discord.js**, then you already know **Robo.js**... almost.

You can develop using the same **Discord.js** you know and **[love](https://opencollective.com/discordjs)**, but you also get access to **[unique features](../robojs/overview)**. This documentation covers everything you need to know about creating **Discord Bots** with **Robo.js**.

## Plugin Power Ups

**[Robo Plugins](../plugins/overview)** are special. They let you add features to your **Robo** with one command.

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/moderation</Terminal>

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](../robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](../plugins/create)**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
	<summary>Can I use my existing code?</summary>

Yes! **Robo.js** is built on top of **Discord.js** and is fully compatible with existing bots. Check out the **[Migration Guide](./migrate)** for more info.

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Can I use any database? Am I forced to use Flashcore?</summary>

**Robo.js** is database agnostic. You can use any database you like, including Flashcore, MongoDB, or even a simple JSON file.

We recommend **Flashcore** for its simplicity, but more mature projects may benefit from a more robust database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. We have **[Templates](/templates/overview)** for those!

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Do I have to use TypeScript?</summary>

Nope! **Robo.js** supports both JavaScript and TypeScript. You can use either or both in the same project.

When creating a new project, uncheck the TypeScript option if you want to use JavaScript. You can always add it later.

</details>

<details>
	<summary>How do I register my commands?</summary>

**You don't!**

**Robo.js** automatically registers your commands when you create them in the `/src/commands` directory. It internally uses a manifest to keep track of changes and only register when necessary.

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Should I still create my own client?</summary>

Nope, **Robo.js** handles the client for you. Configure it in `/config/robo.mjs` and import it via `import { client } from 'robo.js'`.

</details>

<details>
	<summary>What is ESM? Why can't I use `require`?</summary>

ESM (ECMAScript Modules) is the new standard for JavaScript modules. **Robo.js** exclusively uses ESM.

`import` is more powerful than `require` and allows for better tree-shaking and static analysis.
