# ✨ Getting Started with Discord Bots

**Robo.js** makes building **[Discord.js](https://discord.js.org)** bots as easy as putting certain files in the right place. Want to create a command? Just make a file in the `/src/commands` directory. Events? Create files in `/src/events`. It's that simple!

:::tip Robo.js does _not_ replace Discord.js!

Instead, it simplifies coding by handling boilerplate. You still have all of **Discord.js**!

**Got an existing bot?** Check out the **[Migration Guide](./migrate)** for how to use existing code with **Robo.js**.

:::

## Quick Start

Ready to start your adventure? Try **[Create Robo](../cli/create-robo)** in your terminal:

<Terminal create>{'<projectName> -k bot'}</Terminal>

This will spawn a new **Robo.js** project ready to use as a **Discord Bot**. We call these **Robos**.

## File Structure

Discord bots built with Robo.js follow the following file structure:

- `/src/commands`: Slash commands. Can be nested for subcommands or subcommand groups.
- `/src/context`: Context commands for either `/user` or `/message`.
- `/src/events`: Discord events. Can be nested for grouped events.

### Basic Example

```
/src
├── /commands
│   └── ping.js
└── /events
    └── messageCreate.js
```

The above is used to create:

- `/ping` command.
- `messageCreate` event.

### Advanced Example

```
/src
├── /commands
│   ├── ping.js
│   ├── /ban
│   │   └── user.js
│   └── /settings
│       └── /update
│           └── something.js
├── /context
│   ├── /user
│   │   └── Audit.js
│   └── /message
│       └── Report.js
└── /events
    ├── ready.js
    └── /messageCreate
        ├── dm.js
        └── hello.js
```

The above is used to create:

- `/ping` command.
- `/ban user` subcommand.
- `/settings update something` subcommand group.
- `Audit` user context command.
- `Report` message context command.
- `ready` event.
- `dm` and `hello` grouped `messageCreate` events.

### Modules

For larger projects, you can use modules to group similar functionality together as if they were mini-projects within your main project. Each module follows the same file structure.

## Slash Commands

Slash commands in Robo.js are straightforward. Just create a file in the `commands` directory, and the name of the file becomes the name of the command. Easy peasy, right? You can even nest commands for those extra spicy subcommands!

### Example Usage

Creating a command is as easy as exporting a default function from a file in the `/src/commands` directory.

<Tabs groupId="examples-script">
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript title="/src/commands/ping.js"
export default () => {
	return 'Pong!'
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript title="/src/commands/ping.ts"
import type { CommandConfig } from 'robo.js'

export default (): CommandResult => {
	return 'Pong!'
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To learn more about commands and their full potential, head over to the **[Commands Section](./commands)**.

### Registration

It's automatic! Robo.js will register command changes for you whenever you `build` or `dev` your project. So just sit back, relax, and code away!

If you run into any issues or don't see your changes, you can always run `build` with the `--force` flag. This will force Robo.js to clean up and re-register all commands.

</CardContainer>

## Context Commands

Ever right clicked on someone's profile or a message and seen an "Apps" section? Those are context commands!

Creating and registering context commands in Robo.js is no different from regular commands. The `/context` directory can have two subdirectories: `/user` and `/message`. Just like commands, the name of the file becomes the name of the context command.

## Event Listeners

Listening to events using Robo.js again follows the same file structure. Create a file in the `events` directory, and the name of the file becomes the Discord event you're listening to. Noticing a pattern here?

### Example Usage

Registering an event listener is as simple as creating a file in the `/src/events` directory.

<Tabs groupId="examples-script">
<TabItem value="js" label="Javascript">

```javascript showLineNumbers title="/src/events/messageCreate.js"
export default (message) => {
	if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
		message.channel.send('Hello there!')
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts" label="Typescript">

```typescript showLineNumbers title="/src/events/messageCreate.ts"
import type { Message } from 'discord.js'

export default (message: Message) => {
	if (message.content.includes('hello')) {
		message.channel.send('Hello there!')
	}
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your default export is the equivalent of `client.on('messageCreate', (message) => {})` in Discord.js. The same exact parameters are passed to your event listener function.

## Sage Mode

Sage Mode is a powerful feature in Robo.js that simplifies interaction handling. It operates behind the scenes, automatically simplifying interaction handling and providing smart error replies to make debugging easier.

## Plugin Power Ups

**[Robo Plugins](../plugins/overview)** are special. They let you add features to your **Robo** with one command.

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/moderation</Terminal>

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](../robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](../plugins/create)**.
