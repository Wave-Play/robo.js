# @robojs/cron

Effortlessly schedule tasks with cron expressions. This robust plugin allows you to run functions at specified times, manage job persistence, and control tasks dynamically.

## Installation

To add this plugin to your Robo.js project:

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/cron`}</Terminal>

New to **[Robo.js](https://robojs.dev)**? Start your project with this plugin pre-installed:

<Terminal create>{`<project-name> -p @robojs/cron`}</Terminal>

## Usage

Use the `Cron` export to run a function on a schedule.

```javascript
Cron('*/10 * * * * *', () => {
	console.log('This job runs every 10 seconds!')
})
```

You can schedule jobs to run when your **Robo** starts using the `/src/events/_start.js` file.

```javascript
import { Cron } from '@robojs/cron'

export default () => {
	Cron('*/10 * * * * *', () => {
		console.log('This job runs every 10 seconds!')
	})
}
```

`Cron` returns a job object that can be controlled dynamically.

```javascript
const job = Cron('*/10 * * * * *', () => {
	console.log('This job runs every 10 seconds!')
})

// Pause a job
job.pause()

// Resume a job
job.resume()

// Stop a job
job.stop()

// Get the next run time
const nextRun = job.nextRun()
console.log('Next run in', nextRun)
```

### Job File

You can also point to a file to run as a job.

```javascript
import { Cron } from '@robojs/cron'

// File: /src/events/_start.js
export default () => {
	// Runs `/src/cron/job.js` every 5 seconds
	// IMPORTANT: pass a relative path (no leading slash)
	const job = Cron('*/5 * * * * *', 'cron/job.js')
}
```

Your job file should export a default function.

```javascript
// File: /src/cron/job.js
export default () => {
	console.log('@robojs/cron is awesome!')
}
```

### Absolute Paths for Plugins

Plugin authors can use absolute paths to reference cron handlers bundled with their plugin. This is particularly useful when your plugin needs to schedule cron jobs using handlers that are distributed as part of the plugin package.

```javascript
import { Cron } from '@robojs/cron'
import path from 'node:path'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'

// Resolve the plugin's compiled cron handler to an absolute path
const here = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))
const cronJobPath = path.resolve(here, '../cron/my-handler.js')

// Create cron job with absolute path
const job = Cron('*/5 * * * * *', cronJobPath)
await job.save('my-plugin-job')
```

Using absolute paths allows your plugin to reference its own handlers without requiring consumers to copy files into their project. The cron plugin will automatically detect absolute paths and use them directly, while relative paths (like `/cron/job.js`) continue to be resolved from the consumer's `.robo/build` directory.

### Persistence

Jobs can be persisted to ensure they continue after a restart and can be retrieved later.

```javascript
import { Cron } from '@robojs/cron'

// File: /src/commands/start-job.js
export default () => {
	// Runs `/src/cron/job.js` every 5 seconds
	// Use a relative path (no leading slash)
	const job = Cron('*/5 * * * * *', 'cron/job.js')

	// Only file-based jobs can be persisted
	const jobId = await job.save()

	// Retrieve a saved job using its ID
	const savedJob = await Cron.get('my-job')

	// Use the job ID to remove the job later
	await Cron.remove(jobId)
}
```

This is useful for creating long-running tasks as a result of a command or event. You may pass an ID to the `save` method to prevent duplication and make it easier to retrieve the job later.

```javascript
const jobId = await job.save('my-job')
const savedJob = await Cron.get('my-job')
```

## API Overview

Create and initialize a cron job by calling `Cron(cronExpression, jobFunction)`. The `cronExpression` parameter should be a string that defines when the job will run, such as `'*/5 * * * * *'` for every 5 seconds.

```js
const job = Cron('*/5 * * * * *', () => {
	console.log('This job runs every 5 seconds!')
})
```

The `jobFunction` parameter can be either a path to a JavaScript file that exports a function or a direct function definition.

### Job Control

- **pause()**: Temporarily halts the cron job.
- **resume()**: Resumes a paused cron job.
- **stop()**: Permanently stops the cron job from running.

### Job Management

- **save()**: Persists the job so that it continues to run even after a system restart and can be retrieved later. This method returns a Promise that resolves to the unique identifier for the job.
- **get(id)**: Retrieves a previously saved job using its ID. Returns a Promise that resolves to the job instance if found.
- **nextRun()**: Returns the next scheduled run time of the job as a `Date` object, or `null` if there is no scheduled run.

### Removing a Job

Remove a persisted job by using `Cron.remove(id)`, where `id` is the unique identifier returned by the `save()` method. This removes the job from persistence (Flashcore) and clears it from in-memory State, but does not stop a running job. To fully clean up, stop the job first, then remove it:

```ts
const id = 'my-job'
const job = Cron.get(id)
job?.stop()         // halts execution
await Cron.remove(id) // deletes persistence + clears State
```

## Cron Expressions

Cron expressions are used to define the schedule of a job. They consist of six fields separated by spaces:

1. **Seconds**: 0-59
2. **Minutes**: 0-59
3. **Hours**: 0-23
4. **Day of Month**: 1-31
5. **Month**: 1-12
6. **Day of Week**: 0-6 (Sunday to Saturday)

Each field can be a single value, a range, a list of values, or an increment. For example:

- `*` (asterisk): All values
- `*/5`: Every 5 units
- `1,2,3`: Specific values
- `1-5`: Range of values
- `1-5/2`: Range with increment

### Examples

- `* * * * * *`: Every second
- `*/5 * * * * *`: Every 5 seconds
- `0 0 * * * *`: Every hour
- `0 0 0 * * *`: Every day at midnight
- `0 0 0 1 * *`: First day of every month at midnight
- `0 0 0 * * 0`: Every Sunday at midnight
