# @robojs/ai

This plugin morphs your **[Robo](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js)** into a sophisticated AI chatbot. By simply mentioning it or replying to its messages on Discord, you initiate a natural conversation - as if you're chatting with a fellow human!

> 🔑 To bring this magic to life, secure an **[OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/)**. Set it as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and your Robo is good to go.

## Installation 

To add this amazingness to your Robo, just use this spell (I mean, command):

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/ai`}</Terminal>

And there you go! Your Robo, now powered by AI, is ready to have a chat!

New to Robo.js? Start your project with this plugin pre-installed:

<Terminal create>{`<project-name> -p @robojs/ai`}</Terminal>

## Your Robo's Personality 

Desire a Robo with a backstory, specific character traits, or a distinctive personality? Tell it a story with the `systemMessage` config:

```js
// config/plugins/robojs/ai.mjs
export default {
	systemMessage: 'You are Batman, protector of the Weeb City Discord server.'
}
```

## Let's _Talk_ Commands ️

Command your AI Robo in everyday language! Got a `/ban` command? Just say, _"Robo, ban @naughtyAlien for space spamming!"_, and it'll happen. And don't worry, your Robo will only listen to folks with the right permissions (roles).

**Always ensure your slash commands' permissions are configured correctly, whether you use this or not! 🛡️**

> 💡 **By the way...** If you ever want to turn this off, just set the `commands` config field to `false`.

## Special Channels 

You can make special channels where Robo will chat freely, without always being called out. Just use the `whitelist` config:

```js
export default {
	// Other configurations...
	whitelist: {
		channelIds: ['channelID1', 'channelID2']
	}
}
```

## Insights

`insights` is a special config that lets you inject your own custom knowledge into your Robo. It's a great way to make your Robo smarter and more capable!

All you have to do is put files in a folder called `documents` in your Robo's root directory, and your Robo will automatically learn from them.

```
- /robo
	- /src
	- /documents
		- /my-first-document.txt
		- /my-second-document.txt
```

What's more, your Robo will remember what it learns, so it can use it in future conversations! It's like long-term memory for your Robo.

> 💡 **By the way...** If you ever want to turn this off, just set the `insights` config field to `false`.

## Config file 

Here's a quick look at all the settings you can play with:

```js
// config/plugins/robojs/ai.mjs
export default {
	// Model for your AI. You might stick with the default. (string)
	model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',

	// Tell your Robo a backstory or role. (string)
	systemMessage: 'You are a wise wizard of Webland!',

	// Let Robo use or ignore specific commands. true for all commands, false for no commands, array for only specific commands. (boolean or string array)
	commands: ['ban', 'kick', 'dev logs'],

	// Knowledge injection & long-term memory. (boolean; default: true)
	insights: true,

	// Assistant API delay for OpenAI rate limiting (number; default: 1_000)
	pollDelay: 4_000,

	// If specified, your AI will only respond to messages in these channels. (object with array of string IDs)
	restrict: {
		channelIds: ['channelID3']
	},

	// Special channels where Robo talks freely. (object with array of string IDs)
	whitelist: {
		channelIds: ['channelID1', 'channelID2']
	}
}
```

## JavaScript API 

For those who like to tinker and build, this plugin also exposes a JavaScript API to enhance things even further!

```js
import { AI } from '@robojs/ai'

// Prompt a chat query and obtain the AI's response.
AI.chat()

// Be the puppeteer! Control AI events or alter certain values.
AI.on()

// Disconnect from an AI event.
AI.off()
```

We've also got some handy AI tools for you to use:

- `selectOne`: Match strings semantically from a range of choices.
- `chat`: A low-level variant of `AIEngine.chat()` for direct OpenAI API interactions.

And guess what? With tools like these, other cool plugins like `@robojs/ai-voice` let your Robo chat in voice channels too!

## Voice Capabilities ️

If you've added the `@robojs/ai-voice` to your Robo, you're in for a treat! This AI plugin will let your Robo talk in voice channels!

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/ai-voice`}</Terminal>

How cool is that? Your Robo can now talk to you in voice channels, just like a real person!

## Web API 

Now, if you've added the `@robojs/server` to your Robo, there's another treat waiting. This AI plugin will unveil a shiny new `/api/ai/chat` path, letting your Robo have fun chats on websites!

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/server`}</Terminal>

Imagine a chat window with your Robo on your favorite webpage. Pretty cool, right?

## Custom Models 

You can also use your own custom AI models with this plugin. Just set the `model` config your custom model instance and you're good to go!

```js
// config/plugins/robojs/ai.mjs
import LlamaModel from '../../../llama.js'

export default {
	// ... other configurations
	model: new LlamaModel()
}
```

Custom models must extend the `BaseEngine` class from `@robojs/ai`. Here's a quick example:

```js
// llama.js
import { BaseEngine } from '@robojs/ai'

export default class LlamaModel extends BaseEngine {
	async chat(query) {
		return `Llama says: ${query}`
	}
}
```

> **Warning:** The custom model API is still in beta. It may change in the future.

## Troubleshooting ️

If you encounter any issues with this plugin, feel free to reach out to us on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/roboplay)**. We're always here to help you out!

### Common Issues

- **OpenAI API Key**: Ensure you've set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and set up billing on the OpenAI platform.
- **Permissions**: Make sure your Robo has the necessary permissions to read and send messages in the channels you've configured, including the Message Content intent.
- **Rate Limiting**: If you're hitting rate limits, try increasing the `pollDelay` config in your `config/plugins/robojs/ai.mjs` file.
- **Insights**: Ensure your `/documents` folder is correctly set up and contains **[valid text files](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search/supported-files)**. You may need to explicitly tell your Robo to use the uploaded files in your `systemMessage`.
