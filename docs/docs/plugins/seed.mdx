# ðŸŒ± Seeding

Sometimes plugins recommend or require certain files to be present in your project. **Seeding** is a way to automate this process.

## Seed on Install

When you install a plugin with the **[Robo CLI](../cli/robo)**, you may be asked if you want files included and a description of them.

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/server</Terminal>

For example, the **[@robojs/server](./server)** plugin may seed optional files in `/src/api` that shows how to use it. They are optional and can be deleted if you don't want them.

You can also deny **seeding** by using the `--no-seed` flag or by entering `n` when prompted.

```
ðŸ“¦ Installing plugin
   âœ” @robojs/server

ðŸŒ± Seed files detected
   - @robojs/server: Example API route and index page

   Would you like to include these files? [Y/n]: n

âœ¨ Plugin successfully installed and ready to use.
```

If you opted out of **seeding**, you can always add them later by running `robo add` again.

## TypeScript

Seeds are smart enough to detect if you're using **[TypeScript](../robojs/typescript)** and seed `.ts` files instead of `.js`.

However, this is only true if the plugin developer provided **TypeScript** files in the seed. If they didn't, you'll get **JavaScript** files instead even if you're using **TypeScript**.

If you're a plugin developer, we highly recommend providing `.ts` files in the seed, even if your plugin wasn't written in **TypeScript**. This way, users can benefit from type safety right away. The **Robo Compiler** will automatically compile them to **JavaScript** for those who don't use **TypeScript**.

You can also provide both `.ts` and `.js` files if you want finer control over the output instead of relying on the compiler.

## Use Cases

**Seeding** is useful for all kind of things, such as examples, databases, configurations, and more. Here's a list:

- Example files to get you started
- Configuration files
- Database files
- Complex setups
- Boilerplates

Plugins can seed anything they want, and it's up to you to decide if you want them or not.

## Plugin Developers

If you're developing a plugin and want users to have certain files in their project, you can seed them by creating a `/seed` folder in your plugin's root directory.

Anything you put in `/seed` gets copied to the user's `/src` directory. If you want to copy files into the root directory, you can use the `/seed/_root` folder.

```
/seed
â”œâ”€â”€ /_root
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ /api
    â””â”€â”€ hello.ts
```

When the user **[installs your plugin](./install)**, these files are copied to their project if they approve.

While optional, a description of the files is recommended to help users understand what they are getting. You can provide a description in your plugin's **[Robo Config](../robojs/config)** file:

```js title="robo.mjs"
export default {
	// ... rest of config
	seed: {
		description: 'Example API route and index page'
	}
}
```

Now when users install your plugin with `robo add`, they will see a description of the files being seeded before they decide to include them. This helps them make an informed decision.

</CardContainer>

## Environment Variable Seeding

In addition to copying files, plugins can seed environment variables. Robo surfaces the additions before asking for confirmation so users understand exactly what will be written.

```
ðŸ”‘ Environment additions detected
   - @robojs/auth: Adds secure defaults for authentication flows.
        AUTH_SECRET â€“ Secret used to sign and verify authentication payloads.
    Target files: .env

    Add these variables to .env? [Y/n]: Y

ðŸ”‘ Environment variables applied
   âœ” @robojs/auth added AUTH_SECRET
```

### Declaring Static Keys

Add static values under `seed.env.variables`. Robo merges these into any detected `.env*` files without overwriting existing keys unless you explicitly opt in.

```ts title="robo.config.ts"
import type { Config } from 'robo.js'

const config: Config = {
	seed: {
		description: 'Adds environment defaults for Auth.',
		env: {
			description: 'Secures authentication payloads.',
			variables: {
				AUTH_SECRET: {
					description: 'Secret used to sign and verify authentication payloads.',
					overwrite: false,
					value: 'replace-me'
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

export default config
```

### Generating Values with Hooks

Use `seed.hook` when you need to compute values on the fly or tweak the seeding experience. The hook runs before Robo shows the prompt, and anything you return is merged into the `seed` configâ€”perfect for populating environment variables without shipping a separate file.

```ts title="robo.config.ts"
import type { Config } from 'robo.js'

export default <Config>{
	seed: {
		description: 'Initializes Auth secrets.',
		hook: async ({ generators }) => {
			const secret = generators.randomHex(32)

			return {
				env: {
					description: 'Generates a unique AUTH_SECRET.',
					variables: {
						AUTH_SECRET: {
							description: 'Secret used to sign and verify authentication payloads.',
							overwrite: false,
							value: secret
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Hooks run before Robo asks the user to confirm the changes. The inline function return value mirrors the `seed` config, so you can mix static `variables` with computed ones or leave the hook to handle everything dynamically.

### Helpful Utilities

Within hooks, the `helpers.generators` bundle exposes:

- `randomHex(bytes?: number)` â€“ cryptographically strong hex strings.
- `randomBase64(bytes?: number)` â€“ base64 strings without padding.
- `randomUUID()` â€“ UUID v4 values.

The `helpers.log` method prints to the installer's console with the plugin prefix, useful when debugging seeding logic.

> Hooks are inline onlyâ€”there's no need to manage separate files. Robo compiles the function into the manifest automatically.

## Limitations

Seeds cannot be used to modify existing files in the project for security reasons. They can only add new files.

Similarly, seeds can only affect the **Robo** project they are installed in. They cannot modify other projects or files outside of the project's directory.
