# ✨ Robo Plugins

**Robo Plugins** are special. They let you add features to your **Robo** with one command and integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](./robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](./create-robo/plugins)**.

You can install and manage plugins in **Robo.js** either using the **[Robo CLI](../robojs/cli)** or manually.

## Using Robo CLI

The **Robo CLI** has its own commands install the plugin's **NPM package** and **register it** in your Robo's **[configuration](../robojs/config)**.

When dealing with NPM packages, **Robo CLI** will use the executor command's package manager.

| Command         | Package Manager |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `npx robo add`  | `npm install`   |
| `pnpm robo add` | `pnpm add`      |
| `yarn robo add` | `yarn add`      |
| `bun robo add`  | `bun add`       |

### Install

Run in your terminal, replacing `<package>` with the name of the plugin you want to install (e.g. **[@robojs/ai](./ai)**):

<Terminal execute>robo add {'package'}</Terminal>

This will install the package and register it in your Robo's **[configuration](../robojs/config)**. To install many at once:

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/moderation @robojs/server</Terminal>

You can also create a new Robo project with plugins pre-installed:

<Terminal create>{'projectName'} --plugins @robojs/ai @robojs/server</Terminal>

### Uninstall

To remove a plugin:

<Terminal execute>robo remove {'package'}</Terminal>

This will uninstall the package and remove it from your Robo's **[configuration](../robojs/config)**.

### Updates

You can use `robo upgrade` to not only update **Robo.js** itself, but also all installed plugins.

<Terminal execute>robo upgrade</Terminal>

This will show you a list of updates and changelogs for you to select.

## Manually

Don't want to use the **Robo CLI**? You can still install plugins manually. It's not as convenient as using the **Robo CLI**, but it's still a straightforward process.

Here's how you can do it:

### Package Manager

Use the package manager of your choice to install the plugin:

<Terminal install>{'package'}</Terminal>

The same goes for `bun`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`.

### Register Plugin

**Robo.js** knows which plugins to use by looking the `/config/plugins` directory. 

For each plugin you want, create an `.mjs` file in `/config/plugins` with the same name as the plugin's package. The file should export the plugin's configuration.

```javascript title="config/plugins/<package>.mjs"
export default {
	// ... plugin configuration
}
```

Remember to delete the file if you uninstall the plugin.
