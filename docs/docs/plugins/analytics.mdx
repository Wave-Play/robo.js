## Installation 

To add this plugin to your Robo.js project:

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/analytics`}</Terminal>

New to **[Robo.js](https://robojs.dev)**? Start your project with this plugin pre-installed:

<Terminal create>{`<project-name> -p @robojs/analytics`}</Terminal>

## Getting Started 

How does **@robojs/analytics** know which service to use? Simple! Just add your analytics service key to your `.env` file.

For **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)**, it's a tracking ID and secret:

```env
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASURE_ID="G-123456789"
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET="123456789"
```

For **[Plausible](https://plausible.io)**, it's your domain:

```env
PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN="example.com"
```

### Not sure which service to use?

We recommend **[Plausible](https://plausible.io)** for its simplicity and privacy-focused analytics. If you're looking for more tracking, **[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)** may be a better fit. You can also use both or implement your own!

### Seed

This plugin can **[seed](https://robojs.dev/plugins/seed)** your project with a basic tracking setup. This includes tracking **[Slash Commands](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/commands)** and **[Events](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/events)**.

## JavaScript API

An `Analytics` object is available globally in your project.

```javascript
import { Analytics } from '@robojs/analytics'
import type { ChatInputCommandInteraction } from 'discord.js'

export default (interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) => {
	// An event can be anything you want to track.
	Analytics.event('testing_event')

	// A view is a page view or screen view. (not really for discord bots)
	Analytics.view('Test Page')

	// Use a unique identifier per session if you can.
	// This may be more difficult for discord bots, but you can use the user id, guild id, etc.
	const sessionId = interaction.channelId ?? interaction.guildId
	Analytics.event('something_happened', { sessionId })

	// Also include a user id as well whenever possible for greater accuracy.
	Analytics.event('test_event', {
		sessionId: sessionId,
		userId: interaction.user.id
	})

	return 'I just tracked something special!'
}
```

Feel free to use the `Analytics` object anywhere in your project! It's just **JavaScript**, after all!

## Other Services

Want to use a different analytics service? You can add your own service by extending the `BaseEngine` class and passing it in your config.

```javascript
// config/plugins/robojs/analytics.mjs
import { BaseEngine } from '@robojs/analytics'

class MyCustomEngine extends BaseEngine {
	// Implement your custom tracking logic here
}

export default {
	engine: new MyCustomEngine()
}
```

We also offer a `ManyEngine` class that allows you to use multiple analytics services at once.

```javascript
// config/plugins/robojs/analytics.mjs
import { GoogleAnalytics, Plausible, ManyEngine } from '@robojs/analytics'

export default {
	engine: new ManyEngine(new GoogleAnalytics(), new Plausible())
}
```

Mix and match services to your heart's content, or switch between them without needing to update code. Usage remains the same.
