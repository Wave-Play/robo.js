# ✨ Getting Started with Discord Activities

**[Robo.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js)** helps you to create **[Discord Activities](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)** with ease, among **[other things](../getting-started)**.

**Discord Activities** are web apps that run inside Discord and can be built using **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. They use Discord's **[Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord APIs.

## Quick Start

Ready to start your adventure? Try **[Create Robo](../cli/create-robo)** in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName> -k activity
```

This will spawn a new **Robo.js** project ready to use as a **Discord Activity**. We call these **Robos**.

## How does Robo.js help?

**Robo.js** simplifies the process by providing features and an ecosystem of plugins to help you build your **Discord Activity** faster and more efficiently.

Here's what you can expect:

- **[One Project](../robojs/files)**: Everything is in one place, making it easy to manage. No more separate backend and frontend projects.
- **[Integrated Database](../robojs/flashcore)**: Robo.js has an built-in KV database that can be pointed to any data source via adapters.
- **[TypeScript Support](../robojs/typescript)**: TypeScript works out of the box, so you can use it without any setup.
- **[Built-in Tunnels](./tunnels)**: The Robo CLI automatically sets up free Cloudflare tunnels for easy testing.
- **[Plugin System](../plugins/overview)**: Extend your activity's features with plugins that integrate seamlessly.
- **[Easy Hosting](./hosting)**: Deploy your activity for others to use with just one command, or self-host it on your own.
- **[Ecosystem](../plugins/directory)**: A growing ecosystem of plugins, templates, and tools to help you build faster with less effort.

## Documentation

**Discord Activities** are like web apps, but there are a few unique things you should know.

These docs cover everything you need to know about creating **Discord Activities** with **Robo.js**, from setting up your project to adding features and deploying it for others to use.

## Plugin Power Ups

**[Robo Plugins](../plugins/overview)** are special. They let you add features to your **Robo** with one command.

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/sync
```

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](../robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](../plugins/create)**.
