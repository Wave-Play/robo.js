# ✨ Getting Started with Discord Activities

**[Robo.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js)** helps you to create **[Discord Activities](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)** with ease, among **[other things](../getting-started)**.

**Discord Activities** are web apps that run inside Discord and can be built using **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. They use Discord's **[Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord APIs.

## Quick Start

Ready to start your adventure? Try **[Create Robo](../cli/create-robo)** in your terminal:

<Terminal create>{'<projectName> -k activity'}</Terminal>

This will spawn a new **Robo.js** project ready to use as a **Discord Activity**. We call these **Robos**.

## How does Robo.js help?

**Robo.js** simplifies the process by providing features and an ecosystem of plugins to help you build your **Discord Activity** faster and more efficiently.

Here's what you can expect:

- **[One Project](../robojs/files)**: Everything is in one place, making it easy to manage. No more separate backend and frontend projects.
- **[Integrated Database](../robojs/flashcore)**: Robo.js has an built-in KV database that can be pointed to any data source via adapters.
- **[TypeScript Support](../robojs/typescript)**: TypeScript works out of the box, so you can use it without any setup.
- **[Built-in Tunnels](./tunnels)**: The Robo CLI automatically sets up free Cloudflare tunnels for easy testing.
- **[Plugin System](../plugins/overview)**: Extend your activity's features with plugins that integrate seamlessly.
- **[Easy Hosting](../hosting/overview)**: Deploy your activity with just one command for others to use, or self-host it on your own.
- **[Ecosystem](../plugins/directory)**: A growing ecosystem of plugins, templates, and tools to help you build faster with less effort.

## Documentation

**Discord Activities** are like web apps, but there are a few unique things you should know.

These docs cover everything you need to know about creating **Discord Activities** with **Robo.js**, from setting up your project to adding features and deploying it for others to use.

## Plugin Power Ups

**[Robo Plugins](../plugins/overview)** are special. They let you add features to your **Robo** with one command.

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/sync</Terminal>

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](../robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](../plugins/create)**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### • Do I need to use Robo.js for the bot if I use it for my activity?

No, you can keep your bot and activity separate. **[Robo.js is designed for both](../getting-started#choose-your-adventure)**, but you can use it for either if you prefer.

#### • Where can I see my activity in Discord?

Join a voice channel and click on the "Activities" button in the bottom left corner of the screen, or on the bottom right in some text channels. You can then select your activity from the list. 

#### • How do I add multiplayer functionality to my activity?

Use your backend to manage game state and player interactions. Check out our **[multiplayer docs](./multiplayer)**, **[tutorial](https://dev.to/waveplay/how-to-add-multiplayer-to-your-discord-activity-lo1)**, or **[@robojs/sync](../plugins/sync)** for more info.

#### • How do I keep my activity running for others to use?

You can deploy your activity to **[RoboPlay](https://roboplay.dev)** with the `deploy` command. This will **[keep your activity online](../hosting/overview)** 24/7 for others to use.

#### • I'm getting an entry point command error and can't find a launch button. What should I do?

Discord recently changed the way activities are launched. Activities created before this change may not work as expected. You can try **[creating a new activity](https://dev.to/waveplay/how-to-build-a-discord-activity-easily-with-robojs-5bng)** or **[updating your existing one](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command)** to fix this issue.

#### • I'm getting Content Security Policy (CSP) errors. How do I fix them?

Follow the **[Discord Proxy](./proxy)** rules to resolve CSP issues. You may need to **[map external URLs](./proxy#url-mapping)** or **[create a proxy](https://dev.to/waveplay/resolve-content-security-policy-csp-issues-in-your-discord-activity-using-a-nodejs-proxy-2634)** to handle requests.

#### • OAUTH2 Error: invalid_request: Missing "redirect_uri" in request

This error occurs when the redirect URI is, well... missing. Make sure you have the correct redirect URI in your **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)** OAuth section.
