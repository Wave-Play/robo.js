# 🔑 Discord Activity Credentials

For your **Discord Activity** to work, you need to set up a few **[environment variables](/core/env)** to authenticate with **Discord**.

These are secret values that you should never share with anyone. They're stored in a `.env` file, which is automatically loaded by **Robo.js** when you start your project.

## What You Need

Get the following environment variables from the **[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)**.

### Client ID

This is your **Discord Application ID**, found in the **Discord Developer Portal**. Sign in with your **Discord** account, click on your bot application, and find the **Application ID** in the **General Information** tab.

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your_application_id"
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="your_application_id"
```

:::info

The extra `VITE_` copy is required to load the environment variable in the browser. _Do not delete it!_

:::

### Client Secret

This is your **Discord Client Secret**, found in the **OAuth2** tab of your app. You may need to reveal it by clicking **Reset Secret**.

In your `.env` file, add the following line:

```bash title=".env"
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
```

:::tip Reminder

Don't forget to replace `your_client_secret` with the value you just obtained!

:::

### Redirect URI

Even though redirect uris aren't used in Discord Activities, you still need to set one up in the **OAuth2** tab of your app.

![Discord Redirect URI](/img/discord-redirect-uri.png)

This can be any valid URL, such as:

```
https://robojs.dev/
```

:::note

Seriously, they're not used as of now... but you still need to set one up.

:::

## Keep It Secure

Make sure to keep your `.env` file safe and never share it with anyone. If you accidentally expose your credentials, you can regenerate them in the **Discord Developer Portal**.

Remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to your repository.

```bash title=".gitignore"
.env
```

Don't worry, **Robo.js** will automatically load your environment variables when you start your project.
