# ⚔️ Multiplayer

**Discord Activities** are a great way to create multiplayer games and experiences. Even if you're not building a game, you can still use multiplayer features to create collaborative activities or experiences.

Multiplayer features often involve websockets for real-time communication between clients. There are many ways to implement features like this. Depending on what you're building, we recommend either using our **[@robojs/sync](#sync-plugin)** plugin or a more powerful solution like **[Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/)**.

## Sync Plugin

If you're building a **[React](https://react.dev)** app, you can use the **@robojs/sync** plugin to sync state across clients in real-time. This is the easiest way to add multiplayer functionality to your Discord Activity.

Websocket features can be complex to set up, but **@robojs/sync** handles all of that for you. **Robo.js** plugins are designed to work out of the box, no matter how powerful, so you can focus on features!

### Setup

To install, run the following command:

<Terminal execute>robo add @robojs/sync</Terminal>

You will need to wrap your app with the `<SyncProvider>` component. This will handle state synchronization for you.

```tsx title="/src/app/App.tsx"
import { SyncProvider } from '@robojs/sync'

export function App() {
	return (
		<SyncProvider>
			<Activity />
		</SyncProvider>
	)
}
```

### Usage

If you're already familiar with React's `useState` hook, then you'll feel right at home with `useSyncState`. You can use it just like React's `useState` hook, but the state will be synced across all clients in real-time. The only difference is that you need to provide a dependency array as the second argument.

```tsx title="/src/components/Player.tsx"
import { useSyncState } from '@robojs/sync'

export function Player() {
	const [position, setPosition] = useSyncState({ x: 0, y: 0 }, ['position'])

	const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
		setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY })
	}

	return (
		<div onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
			Position: {position.x}, {position.y}
		</div>
	)
}
```

Updating the state will cause all clients to receive the new state in real-time. When doing so, we recommend using an updater function to ensure you're always working with the latest state.

```tsx title="/src/components/Player.tsx"
const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
	setPosition((prev) => ({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }))
}
```

### Dependency Array

The dependency array (`['position']`) is used to determine which clients should share the same state. In this case, all clients with the same dependency array will share the same `position` state. You can use any value in the dependency array, such as the user's ID or a room ID.

```tsx title="/src/components/Player.tsx"
const { session } = useDiscordSdk()
const [position, setPosition] = useSyncState({ x: 0, y: 0 }, [session.user.id, 'position'])
```

## Colyseus

If you're building a more complex multiplayer game, we recommend using **[Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/)**.

Colyseus is a powerful multiplayer game server that handles real-time communication between clients. It is well tested, scalable, and designed for building real-time multiplayer games. It works great with pretty much any game engine, UI library, or framework. That includes **Robo.js**!

### Setup

Unlike Robo plugins, Colyseus requires a bit more setup. Let's start by installing dependencies:

<Terminal install>@colyseus/core @colyseus/schema @colyseus/ws-transport colyseus.js</Terminal>

From here on, you'll need to:

1. **Create a Server**: We recommend extending `NodeEngine` in **[@robojs/server](../plugins/server)** to work with Colyseus.
2. **Define Schemas**: Use **[@colyseus/schema](https://docs.colyseus.io/schema/)** to define your state schemas.
3. **Define Rooms**: Create rooms that handle game logic and state synchronization.
4. **Connect Clients**: Use **[Colyseus.js](https://docs.colyseus.io/client/)** to connect clients to your server.

If the above sounds complicated, don't worry! We've created a template to help you get started!

<Terminal create>{'<project-name> --template discord-activities/react-colyseus-ts'}</Terminal>

### Usage

Once you've set up your server and rooms, you can start using Colyseus to handle real-time communication between clients. You can use Colyseus to handle game logic, state synchronization, and more.

```ts title="/src/core/colyseus.ts"
import { Client } from 'colyseus.js'

const client = new Client('ws://localhost:2567')
const room = client.join('my_room')

room.onStateChange((state) => {
	console.log('New state:', state)
})
```

We recommend creating a **[Context Provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)** to manage the Colyseus client and room. This will allow you to access the client and room from anywhere in your activity.
