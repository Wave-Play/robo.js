# ✨ Getting Started

**Robo.js** is a powerful framework for building epic **Discord** experiences.

It lets you **[reduce boilerplate](./robojs/files)**, **[add features instantly](./plugins/overview)**, **[follow best practices](./robojs/sage)**, **[deploy with ease](./hosting/overview)**, **[automate tasks](./discord-activities/tunnels)**, **[persist data](./robojs/flashcore)**, **[debug inline](./discord-bots/debug)**, **[share features](./plugins/create)**, **[manage state](./robojs/state)**, **[stay organized](./robojs/modules)**, **[join an ecosystem](./plugins/directory)**, and **[so much more](./robojs/overview)**. All for **[less than 700kB](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=robo.js)**.

Best of all, **[it works with your existing code](./discord-bots/migrate)**. You may even find it **[fun](./discord-activities/games)**!

## Quick Start

This will spawn a new **Robo.js** project ready to use. We call these **Robos**.

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](./robojs/files)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](./plugins/create)**.
