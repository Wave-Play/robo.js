# React (JS)

Welcome to your fresh **[Robo.js](https://robojs.dev)** project!

Build, deploy, and maintain your **Discord Activities** with ease. With **Robo.js** as your guide, you'll experience a seamless, **[file-based setup](https://robojs.dev/discord-activities/file-structure)**, an **[integrated database](https://robojs.dev/robojs/flashcore)**, **[TypeScript support](https://robojs.dev/robojs/typescript)**, and a **[rich ecosystem](https://robojs.dev/plugins/overview)**.

_Ready to embark on this adventure?_

##  Getting Started

Create a project with this template, replacing `<project-name>` with your desired name:

<Terminal create>{`--template discord-activities/react-js --name <project-name>`}</Terminal>

Then navigate into your project directory:

<Terminal>{`cd <project-name>`}</Terminal>

Run development mode:

<Terminal>{`npm run dev`}</Terminal>

> **Notes:** A free Cloudflare tunnel is included for easy testing. You can copy and paste it into activity's **[URL mapping](https://robojs.dev/discord-activities/proxy#url-mapping)** to test things out.

## Ô∏è App Development

You can find your client-side code in the `/src/app` folder. This is where you can build your web app using React, Vue, or any other front-end framework.

Things are powered by Vite under the hood, so you get the latest ES modules, hot module reloading, and more! ‚ö°

Try editing the `main` file to get started! (`Activity.tsx` if you're using React)

##  Authentication

The React template makes it easy to authenticate your activity with Discord. The `<DiscordProvider>` components in `App.tsx` accepts `authenticate` and `scope` props.

```tsx
<DiscordContextProvider authenticate scope={['identify', 'guilds']}>
	<Activity />
</DiscordContextProvider>
```

You can then get the SDK and other goodies from the `useDiscordSdk` hook!

## Ô∏è Backend Development

Your server-side code is located in the `/src/api` folder. This is where you can build your API, webhooks, and other fancy server-side features.

This backend is powered by [**@robojs/server**](https://robojs.dev/plugins/server) - a powerful Robo plugin that creates an manages a Node `http` server for you. If you install Fastify, the server will automatically switch to it for better performance!

Everything Robo is file-based, so you can create new routes by making new files in the `/src/api` directory. The file's name becomes the route's path. For example, let's try making a new route at `/health` by creating a new file named `health.js`:

```js
export default () => {
	return { status: 'ok' }
}
```

##  Folder Structure

While the `api` and `app` folders are reserved for your server and client-side code, you are free to create anything else in the `/src` directory!

Folders only become reserved when you install a plugin that uses them. For example, bot functionality uses the `commands` and `events` folders.

## Robo Ecosystem

By building with **Robo.js**, you gain access to a growing ecosystem of **[plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/directory)**, **[templates](https://robojs.dev/templates/overview)**, and **[tools](https://robojs.dev/cli/overview)**. **[Robo Plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/overview)** are special. They can add features with one command.

<Terminal execute>{`robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/sync`}</Terminal>

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/file-structure)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](https://robojs.dev/plugins/create)**.

## Hosting

**Hosting** your project keeps it running 24/7. No need to keep your computer on at all times, or worry about your Internet connection.

You can host on any platform that supports **Node.js**, or run [`robo deploy`](https://robojs.dev/cli/robo#distributing) to host on **[RoboPlay](https://roboplay.dev)** - a hosting platform optimized for **Robo.js**.

<Terminal>{`npm run deploy`}</Terminal>
