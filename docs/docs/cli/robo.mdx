Commands:
  dev [options]         Ready, set, code your bot to life! Starts development mode.
  start [options]       Starts your bot in production mode.

  build [options]       Builds your bot for production.

```

### Running

- **`dev`**: The primary way to run your Robo during development. It behaves similarly to `nodemon` or `ts-node-dev`, restarting your project when changes are detected. This command runs `build` behind the scenes, automatically updating bot commands.
- **`start`**: Used for running your Robo in production after running `build`. This is only necessary if you're self-hosting instead of using RoboPlay to host your Robo for free.

### Building

- **`build`**: Prepares your project for production by compiling your source files, generating a manifest file, and registering any command updates. Use `--no-register` to skip automatic command registration. You need to run this command before using `start`.
- **`build plugin`**: Works similarly to `build`, but optimizes your source files to be published as a plugin via npm.

### Build Options

- `--force`
  - Forces re-registration of all commands, even if unchanged.
  - Usage: `robo build --force`
  - Use when commands aren’t updating properly or Discord cache issues arise.

- `--no-register`
  - Skips automatic command registration during build.
  - Usage: `robo build --no-register`
  - Use when handling registration manually via the `registerSlashCommands()` API.
  - Can be combined with other flags, e.g., `robo build --no-register --verbose`.

For more control over command registration, see the **[Command Registration Guide](/discord-bots/command-registration)**.

### Plugins

- **`add`**: Installs a plugin from npm and registers it with your Robo. You can also use this command to install plugins from a local directory!
- **`remove`**: Uninstalls a plugin from your Robo and removes its config file.

### Other

- **`help`**: Displays help for this CLI or a specific command. Can be used like this: `robo help` or also as a command option `robo build --help`
- **`upgrade`**: Updates Robo.js and all installed plugins.

### Distributing

- **`deploy`**: Bundles your Robo's source files and hosts it on RoboPlay for free (currently invite-only).
- **`invite`**: Generates an invite link to add your Robo onto Discord servers with permissions and all. For more information on adding your bot, refer to the **[Adding to Discord Servers](/discord-bots/invite)** docs.
