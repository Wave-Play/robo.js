/**
 * Core type definitions shared by the Robo.js roadmap plugin.
 *
 * @remarks
 * These types are consumed by roadmap providers, synchronization workflows, and Discord rendering
 * pipelines. They intentionally capture the minimal fields necessary to translate external
 * project management data into Discord friendly content while remaining flexible for future
 * extensions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { RoadmapCard, SyncResult } from '@robojs/roadmap';
 *
 * const card: RoadmapCard = {
 *   id: 'CARD-42',
 *   title: 'Voice transcription support',
 *   description: 'Expose voice transcription results inside the Discord activity.',
 *   labels: ['voice', 'beta'],
 *   column: 'In Progress',
 *   assignees: [
 *     { id: 'user-123', name: 'Alex Example', avatarUrl: 'https://cdn.example/avatar.png' },
 *   ],
 *   url: 'https://jira.example/browse/CARD-42',
 *   updatedAt: new Date(),
 *   metadata: { priority: 'High' },
 * };
 *
 * const result: SyncResult = {
 *   cards: [card],
 *   columns: [
 *     { id: 'in-progress', name: 'In Progress', order: 2, archived: false },
 *   ],
 *   syncedAt: new Date(),
 *   stats: { total: 1, created: 1, updated: 0, archived: 0, errors: 0 },
 * };

// Card Creation -------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Input required to create a new roadmap card in the external provider.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface captures the minimum data needed to create a card across any provider
 * implementation. Providers should map these fields to their native data models (e.g., Jira
 * issue fields, GitHub issue properties).
 *
 * Provider-specific considerations:
 * - Column names must match one of the columns returned by the provider's `getColumns()` method
 * - Assignee IDs must be valid user identifiers in the provider's system
 * - Labels should follow the provider's naming conventions and constraints
 * - Issue type names must match one of the types returned by the provider's `getIssueTypes()` method
 * - If issue type is omitted, the provider's configured default issue type is used
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { CreateCardInput } from '@robojs/roadmap';
 *
 * const input: CreateCardInput = {
 *   title: 'Add dark mode support',
 *   description: 'Implement dark mode theme across the application',
 *   column: 'Backlog',
 *   labels: ['enhancement', 'ui'],
 *   issueType: 'Task'
 * };
 * ```
 */

	 */

// Card Updates ---------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Input required to update an existing roadmap card in the external provider.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface supports partial updates - only provided fields are changed in the provider.
 * Omitted fields remain unchanged, allowing targeted edits without fetching and resending all
 * card data.
 *
 * Provider-specific considerations:
 * - All fields are optional; at least one field should be provided for a meaningful update
 * - Column names must match one of the columns returned by the provider's `getColumns()` method
 * - Assignee IDs must be valid user identifiers in the provider's system
 * - Labels completely replace existing labels; provide the full desired set
 * - Some providers may have limitations (e.g., Jira supports only one assignee)
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { UpdateCardInput } from '@robojs/roadmap';
 *
 * // Update only the title
 * const input1: UpdateCardInput = {
 *   title: 'Updated title'
 * };
 *
 * // Update multiple fields
 * const input2: UpdateCardInput = {
 *   title: 'Add dark mode support',
 *   description: 'Implement dark mode theme across the application',
 *   column: 'In Progress',
 *   labels: ['enhancement', 'ui', 'wip']

// Synchronization Results ---------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Captures the result of a synchronization run between a provider and the roadmap surface.

 * archived within Discord. The stats block enables runtime analytics and logging without inspecting

// Date Range Filtering ------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Specifies filtering criteria for fetching roadmap cards by date range.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This interface enables programmatic retrieval of cards within specific time windows, useful
 * for fetching recent changes, generating reports, or analyzing activity over time. The filter
 * supports both Date objects and ISO 8601 strings for maximum flexibility across different
 * JavaScript environments and serialization scenarios.
 *
 * Date field semantics:
 * - `created`: Filters by the card creation timestamp
 * - `updated`: Filters by the last modification timestamp (default)
 *
 * Default behavior when date fields are omitted:
 * - If only `startDate` is provided: Fetches cards from that date forward
 * - If only `endDate` is provided: Fetches cards up to that date
 * - If neither is provided: Behavior is provider-specific (may return all cards or apply a default range)
 *
 * Provider-specific considerations:
 * - Date field availability varies by provider (Jira supports both 'created' and 'updated', GitHub may have different field names)
 * - Date precision and timezone handling is provider-specific; implementations should document their timezone behavior
 * - Some providers may have limitations on date range queries (e.g., maximum range, pagination requirements)
 * - Large date ranges may require pagination; providers should handle this transparently
 * - Results should be cached with appropriate TTL to minimize API calls
 *
 * @example
 * Fetching cards from last month using Date objects:
 * ```ts
 * import type { DateRangeFilter } from '@robojs/roadmap';
 *
 * const lastMonth = new Date();
 * lastMonth.setMonth(lastMonth.getMonth() - 1);
 *
 * const filter: DateRangeFilter = {
 *   startDate: lastMonth,
 *   endDate: new Date()
 * };
 *
 * const cards = await provider.fetchCardsByDateRange?.(filter);
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Fetching cards in a specific range using ISO strings:
 * ```ts
 * const filter: DateRangeFilter = {
 *   startDate: '2025-09-01',
 *   endDate: '2025-09-30'
 * };
 *
 * const septemberCards = await provider.fetchCardsByDateRange?.(filter);
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Filtering by created date instead of updated date:
 * ```ts
 * const filter: DateRangeFilter = {
 *   startDate: '2025-01-01',
 *   dateField: 'created'
 * };
 *
 * const cardsCreatedThisYear = await provider.fetchCardsByDateRange?.(filter);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link import('./providers/base.js').RoadmapProvider.fetchCardsByDateRange}
 */
export type DateRangeFilter = {
	/**
	 * The beginning of the date range (inclusive).
	 * Accepts both Date objects and ISO 8601 strings (e.g., '2025-01-01').
	 */
	readonly startDate?: Date | string
	/**
	 * The end of the date range (inclusive).
	 * Accepts both Date objects and ISO 8601 strings (e.g., '2025-01-31').
	 */
	readonly endDate?: Date | string
	/**
