# @robojs/ai-voice

Welcome to _@robojs/ai-voice_! This plugin is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing **[Robo.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo)** project and provide new features and enhancements to your robo. The best part? Everything automatically works once you install this plugin!

## Installation ðŸ’»

To install this plugin, navigate to your existing Robo project's directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/ai-voice
```

That's it! Your Robo now has access to the additional features provided by this plugin. The plugin's commands and events are automatically linked, and if your Robo requires any additional bot permissions, they will be inherited when running `npx robo invite` to generate an invite link.

Enjoy your enhanced Robo! ðŸš€
