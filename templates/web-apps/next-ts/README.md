# Web App - Next (TS)

Meet the **Next.js edition** of our web-app template! If you’ve used the
[`react-ts`](https://robojs.dev/templates/web-apps/react-ts) starter before, this
is the same experience—but powered entirely by **Next.js** instead of Vite. You
still get Robo’s batteries-included DX (file-based structure, Flashcore,
TypeScript, rich plugin ecosystem), now paired with Next’s routing, React Server
Components, and production tooling.

## ✨ Getting Started

Create a project with this template, replacing `<project-name>` with your desired name:

```bash
npx create-robo --template web-apps/next-ts --name <project-name>
```

Then navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

Run development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **Notes:** A free Cloudflare tunnel is included for easy testing.

## App Development 🛠️

You can find your client-side code in the `/src/app` folder. This is where you can build your web app using React, Vue, or any other front-end framework.

The front end runs on **Next.js**, so you get fast refresh, file-based routing,
and React Server Components out of the box. Next-specific code lives under
`/app`, while everything Robo (APIs, commands, plugins, etc.) stays under
`/src`. Create a new route at `/app/example/page.tsx` and visit `/example`
while `npm run dev` is running.

Need the classic client-side-only flow? You can still use Next’s `app` router
to serve fully client-driven pages, plus hybrid routes that share code with
your Robo APIs.

#### Authenticating

The React template makes it easy to authenticate your activity with Discord. The `<DiscordProvider>` components in `App.tsx` accepts `authenticate` and `scope` props.

```tsx
<DiscordContextProvider authenticate scope={['identify', 'guilds']}>
	<Activity />
</DiscordContextProvider>
```

You can then get the SDK and other goodies from the `useDiscordSdk` hook!

## Backend Development 🛠️

Your server-side code is located in the `/src/api` folder. This is where you can build your API, webhooks, and other fancy server-side features.

This backend is powered by [**@robojs/server**](https://robojs.dev/plugins/server)
—the same engine that ships with other Robo templates. Because we route
unmatched requests into Next.js, your React app and APIs share a single server
process.

Everything Robo is file-based, so you can create new routes by making new files in the `/src/api` directory. The file's name becomes the route's path. For example, let's try making a new route at `/health` by creating a new file named `health.js`:

```js
export default () => {
	return { status: 'ok' }
}
```

## Folder Structure 📁

While the `api` and `app` folders are reserved for your server and client-side code, you are free to create anything else in the `/src` directory!

Folders only become reserved when you install a plugin that uses them. For example, bot functionality uses the `commands` and `events` folders.

## Robo Ecosystem

By building with **Robo.js**, you gain access to a growing ecosystem of **[plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/directory)**, **[templates](https://robojs.dev/templates/overview)**, and **[tools](https://robojs.dev/cli/overview)**. **[Robo Plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/overview)** are special. They can add features with one command.

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/sync
```

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/file-structure)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](https://robojs.dev/plugins/create)**.

## Building & Hosting

When you’re ready for production you’ll want both halves of the project
compiled:

```bash
npx next build
npx robo build
```

`next build` generates the optimized React output while `robo build` packages
your Robo server, commands, and plugins. Run both before deploying to your
preferred platform.

**Hosting** your project keeps it running 24/7. No need to keep your computer on at all times, or worry about your Internet connection.

You can host on any platform that supports **Node.js**, or run [`robo deploy`](https://robojs.dev/cli/robo#distributing) to host on **[RoboPlay](https://roboplay.dev)** - a hosting platform optimized for **Robo.js**.

```bash
npm run deploy
```
