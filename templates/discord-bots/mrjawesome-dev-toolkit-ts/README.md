## Development

Creating a **[Slash Command](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/commands)** is as easy as creating files.

Let's say you want a new `/hello` command. Just create a file in the `/src/commands` directory named `hello.js` and export a default function that returns something.

```javascript title="/src/commands/hello.js"
export default (interaction) => {
	interaction.reply('Hello World!')
}
```

Your `/hello` command is now ready to use! **Robo.js** takes care of registration for you.

Ever clicked on an avatar or message and seen an _Apps_ section? Those are **[Context Commands](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/context-menu)**!

Create a file file in `/src/context/message` named after the command. For example, `Quote.js`.

```javascript title="/src/context/message/Quote.js"
export default (interaction, message) => {
	interaction.reply(`${message.author} said:\n\n> ${message.content}`)
}
```

You can do the same for users under `/src/context/user`.

## Debugging

**Discord Bots** made with **Robo.js** come with a built-in **[Debugger](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/debug)**.

Whenever your bot crashes in development mode, the debugger shows an interactive error message - all within **Discord**!

You even get `/dev` **[Subcommands](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/commands#subcommands)** for quick access to logs, system info, and more. Just set your test server's ID as an **environment variable** called `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`.

## Client Configuration

**Robo.js** manages your **Discord.js** `Client` instance. You may import `client` anywhere in your project.

```javascript
// File: /src/commands/name.js
import { client } from 'robo.js'

export default () => {
	return `My name is ${client.user.username}`
}
```

Intents or other configurations can be set in the `config/robo.mjs` file.

```javascript
// File: /config/robo.mjs
export default {
	clientOptions: {
		intents: ['Guilds', 'GuildMessages']
	}
	// ... other options
}
```

## Robo Ecosystem

By building with **Robo.js**, you gain access to a growing ecosystem of **[plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/directory)**, **[templates](https://robojs.dev/templates/overview)**, and **[tools](https://robojs.dev/cli/overview)**. **[Robo Plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins/overview)** are special. They can add features with one command.

```bash
npx robo add @robojs/ai @robojs/moderation
```

Plugins integrate seamlessly thanks to the **[Robo File Structure](https://robojs.dev/discord-bots/file-structure)**. What's more, anyone can **[create a plugin](https://robojs.dev/plugins/create)**.

## Hosting

**Hosting** your project keeps it running 24/7. No need to keep your computer on at all times, or worry about your Internet connection.

You can host on any platform that supports **Node.js**, or run [`robo deploy`](https://robojs.dev/cli/robo#distributing) to host on **[RoboPlay](https://roboplay.dev)** - a hosting platform optimized for **Robo.js**.

```bash
npm run deploy
```
