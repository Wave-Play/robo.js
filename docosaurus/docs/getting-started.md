# Getting Started

Dive into the world of Robo.js, where developing Discord bots is more fun, easier, and seamlessly integrates with plugins. 🎉

## Quickstart 🚀

The easiest way to get started with Robo.js is to use the interactive CLI. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName>
```

This command guides you through setting up a project tailored to your preferences, including TypeScript, linting, styling, and plugins.

> Note: Don't forget to replace `<projectName>` with the desired name for your new Robo.

## Upgrading Existing Project ⏫

Depending on your bot's complexity, there are 3 smooth migration paths to choose from. Each tailored to make your bot's transition as seamless as possible.

Check out our migration guide for a detailed breakdown of the 3 migration options, and pick the one that suits your bot best. Get ready to level up your bot development experience!
